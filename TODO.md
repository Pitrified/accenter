# TODO and ideas

1. Filter out words very similar to English.
1. Optional accent filter.
1. Cluster by categories.
1. Show all senses.
1. Show number of letters.
1. Show which letter is accented.
1. Remove surnames and first names.
   Filter `categories` similar to `French surnames`, `French given names`, `French female given names`.
1. Button to blacklist a word.
1. Button to show more info on the word (categories, form_of, ...)
1. Buttons to skip the word or request some hints.
1. Loading the records asynchronously and showing a progress bar would be a neat exercise.
1. View with what is basically a dictionary that shows all the words with glosses/freq/errors? Sortable by error?
1. Option to give a lot more weight to words with errors.
1. Some way to backup the pretend database.
